        <i>
          I got sunshine in my stomach<br />
          Like I just rocked my baby to sleep<br />
          I got sunshine in my stomach<br />
          But I can't keep me from creeping sleep<br />
          Sleep, deep in the deep</i
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Rockface moves to press my skin<br />
        White liquid turns sour within<br />
        Turn fast, turn sour<br />
        Turn sweat, turn sour
      </p>

      <p>
        Must tell myself that I'm not here<br />
        I'm drowning in a liquid fear<br />
        Bottled in a strong compression<br />
        My distortion shows obsession
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >In the cave<br />
          Get me out of this cave</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        If I keep my self-control<br />
        I'll be safe in my soul<br />
        And the childhood belief<br />
        Brings a moment's relief<br />
        But my cynic soon returns<br />
        And the lifeboat burns<br />
        My spirit just never learns
      </p>

      <p>
        Stalactites, stalagmites<br />
        Shut me in, lock me tight<br />
        Lips are dry, throat is dry<br />
        Feels like burning, stomach churning
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm dressed up in a white costume<br />
        Padding out leftover room<br />
        Body stretching, feel the wrenching
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >In the cage<br />
          Get me out of the cage</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        In the glare of a light<br />
        I see a strange kind of sight<br />
        Of cages joined to form a star<br />
        Each person can't go very far<br />
        All tied to their things<br />
        They're netted by their strings<br />
        Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside the cage I see my Brother John<br />
        He turns his head so slowly round<br />
        I cry out "Help!"<br />
        Before he can be gone<br />
        And he looks at me without a sound<br />
        And I shout out "John please help me!"<br />
        But he does not even want to try to speak<br />
        I'm helpless in my violent rage<br />
        And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek<br />
        And I watch him turn away and leave the cage<br />
        My little runaway
      </p>

      <p>
        In a trap, feel a strap<br />
        Holding still<br />
        Pinned for kill<br />
        Chances narrow that I'll make it<br />
        In the cushioned straight-jacket<br />
        Just like 22nd street<br />
        They got me by my neck and feet<br />
        Pressures building, can't take more<br />
        My headaches charge, ear aches roar
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >In this pain<br />
          Get me out of this pain</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        If I could change to liquid<br />
        I could fill the cracks up in the rocks<br />
        I know that I am solid<br />
        And I am my own bad luck
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside John disappears, and my cage dissolves<br />
        Without any reason, my body revolves
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep on turning<br />
        Keep on turning<br />
        Keep on turning<br />
        Keep on turning<br />
        Keep on turning<br />
        Turning around<br />
        Just spinning around
      </p>
